> As a special surprise, we've been allowed to post one of the earliest forms of the EverQuest client! Less than 2 megs zipped up, it's well worth the download if you're interested in seeing how EverQuest started.

> ["Proof of Concept" EverQuest Client](https://web.archive.org/web/20010331085904/http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/eqclient.jsp) - Take a look at the EverQuest client in its earliest form.

[A page dedicated to the client](https://web.archive.org/web/20010813233659/http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/eqclient.jsp) included these instructions:

> **Early EQ Client**
>
> This is a very early EverQuest client. The technical term in the industry is "proof of concept." A total of less than 2 megs zipped up, this program will let you walk around, switch between two different views, and see a couple of NPCs!
>
> *Instructions*
>
> * Click here to Download the EQ client.
> * Make a new directory on your hard drive and unzip the contents of the file into that directory. All files must be in the same directory.
> * Set your desktop to 256 colors. It won't run in anything higher.
> * Double click "everquest.exe"
> * Login is: solo
> * Leave the password field blank.
> * The client will start in a window. Hit "F2" to go to full-screen mode.
> * To exit the client, hit your escape key.
> * Move around using the arrow keys. To jump, hit the + key on your keypad. You can even set the "power" of your jump by typing jump xxx where xxx is a number. Be aware you can literally fly off the map this way. :)
>
> Thanks to Uenelr Flamefist of Druzzil Ro and Nanlayan D'Vrynn of Tarew Marr for writing in with the info about the jump options!
>
> Thanks to Brad McQuaid, Jeff Butler, and Gordon Wrinn for helping us to acquire this little gem!
