## Usage

```bash
> FFCREATE.exe
WAD File Creation Utility v1.40, Copyright 1995-1996 PyroTechnix, Inc.
Usage: FFCREATE [-8.3] [WAD file]
       This program bundles all of the files in the current directory
       together into a single file. The name of the resulting file is
       specified on the command line. If the WAD file name is omitted,
       the file is named RESULT.FF and is placed in the root directory
       of the current drive. Do not attempt to create the WAD file in
       the same directory as the source files. The '-8.3' option can be
       used to reduce the WAD file size slightly in the case that only
       DOS 8.3 file names are used.
```
